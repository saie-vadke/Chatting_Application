# Chatting_Application

The Java Chat application you are going to build is a console application that is launched from the command line. The server and clients can run on different computers in the same network, e.g. Local Area Network (LAN).

There can be multiple clients connect to a server and they can chat to each other, just like in a chat room where everyone can see other users’ messages. There’s no private chat between two users, for simplicity.

After getting connected to the server, a user must provide his or her name to enter the chat. The server sends a list of currently online users to the new user.

Every user is notified when a new user arrives and when a user has gone. Each message is prefixed with the username to keep track who sent the message.

And finally, the user says ‘bye’ to quit the chat.

The application consists of two parts: server and client. Each part can run independently on separate computers.

Now, let’s see how to code this Java chat application in details.
